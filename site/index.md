Hi there, you can call me Kait.
I'm a computer science + maths student completing my
undergraduate thesis.

Most of my experience is in &ldquo;modern&rdquo; web development.
I'm interested in compilers, and formal methods and static analysis.
Currently, I do work on binary analysis.

Sometimes, I do coding problems and puzzles like Advent of Code.
Functional programming is exciting!

If you want, you can reach me at k(at)rina.fyi or on Twitter as [\@kaitrna](https://twitter.com/kaitrna).

Have a great day! ^_^
