Hi there, you can call me Katrina or Kait. I'm a computer science + maths graduate looking for _something_.

Most of my experience is in &ldquo;modern&rdquo; web development but I'm more
interested in compilers and programming language theory, as well as
theoretical computer science.

Sometimes, I do coding problems and puzzles like Advent of Code.
Functional programming is very cool and everyone should do more of that!
Some things I hope to learn are category theory and type theory.

If you want, you can reach me at k(at)rina.fyi or on Twitter as [\@kaitrna](https://twitter.com/kaitrna).

Have a great day! ^_^
